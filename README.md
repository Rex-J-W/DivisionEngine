# DivisionEngine

Division Engine is an SDF-based game engine written entirely in C#. Utilizing Avalonia UI for the interface and Silk.Net for native rendering, Division Engine has a complete build pipeline completely written in C#.

The render pipeline is built using an OpenGL backend with HLSL shaders written in C# using ComputeSharp.

Picture this:
- SDF-based rendering
- GPU compute acceleration in C#
- Open source
- Simple tooling

(More coming soon)
